# Insert to Middle of an Array
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

Example:

Input | Output
-----|-----
[2,4,6,-8], 5 | [2,4,5,6,-8]
[42,8,15,23,42], 16 | [42,8,15,16,23,42]

**Stretch Goal**

Write a second function that removes an element from the middle index and shifts other elements in the array to fill the new gap.

We whiteboarded problem domain, edge cases, visual, big o, algorithm and verification. Then we worked on the code to figure out the pseudo afterwards.
For big o, the bigger the list the more space and time.
