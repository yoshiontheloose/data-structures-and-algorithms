# Code Challenge 36: Graph Breadth First

## Challenge

Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

Write the following method for the Graph class:

breadth first

- Arguments: Node

- Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.

- Display the collection

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
