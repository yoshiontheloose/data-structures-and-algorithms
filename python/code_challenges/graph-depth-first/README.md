# Code Challenge 38: Graph Depth First

## Challenge

Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

Write the following method for the Graph class:

- Name: Depth first

- Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)

- Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order

- Program output: Display the collection

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
