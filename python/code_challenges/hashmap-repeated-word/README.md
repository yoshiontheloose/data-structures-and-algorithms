# Code challenge 31: hashmap-repeated-word

## Feature Tasks

Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string

Arguments: string

Return: string

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
