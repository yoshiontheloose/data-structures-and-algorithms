# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

**append**

- arguments: new value

- adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

**insert before**

- arguments: value, new value

- adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

**insert after**

- arguments: value, new value

- adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Unit Tests

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

1. Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list

2. Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list

3. Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list

4. Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list

5. Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list

6. Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
