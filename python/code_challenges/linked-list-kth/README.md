# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Write the following method for the Linked List class:

kth from end

- argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
- Return the node’s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
- You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

Unit Tests

Write tests for the following scenarios, and any other cases that help you ensure your code is working as expected.

1. Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
2. Where k and the length of the list are the same
3. Where k is not a positive integer
4. Where the linked list is of a size 1
5. “Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list

_Unit tests must be passing before you submit your final solution code._
