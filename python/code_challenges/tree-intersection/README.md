# Code Challenge 32

## Feature Tasks

Write a function called `tree_intersection` that takes two binary trees as parameters.

Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

## Example

Input:

![tree1](/code_challenges/tree-intersection/BT1.png)

![tree2](/code_challenges/tree-intersection/BT2.png)

Output:

100, 160, 125, 175, 200, 350, 500
