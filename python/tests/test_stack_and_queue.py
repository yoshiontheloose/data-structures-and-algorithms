# Write tests to prove the following functionality:

# Can successfully push onto a stack
# Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
# Can successfully pop off the stack
# Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
# Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
# Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
# Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception

# Can successfully enqueue into a queue
# Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
# Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
# Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
# Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
# Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
# Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
